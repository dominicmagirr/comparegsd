\title{Plot the expected sample size of several group-sequential designs on one plot, for comparison.}
\usage{
draw_e_info(d_list, d_spec, ez = seq(0, 5, length.out = 100),
  graph_params = list(z_scale = TRUE, z_limits = c(-4, 4), n_x_points = 400,
  hazard_scale = FALSE), include_delay = FALSE)
}
\description{
\code{draw_e_info} calls \code{get_e_info} for a list of group-sequential designs and creates a ggplot2 object. 
Some aspects of the plot can be controlled with \code{graph_params}.
}
\details{
\param{d_list} A list of group-sequential design objects. Usually these are created from \code{gsDesign}.
\param{d_spec} Design specification that is common to all designs being considered. This is list containing the sample size 
for a fixed design, allocation ratio, length of delay, etc. 
\param{ez} The expected z values to calculate power under.
\param{graph_params} A list of graphical parameters to control the plot: \code{z_scale} (default = \code{TRUE}, if false will plot
on the treatment effect scale), \code{z_limits}, \code{n_x_points}, \code{hazard_scale} (default = \code{FALSE}, if true will overide 
\code{z_scale} and plot on hazard ratio scale).
\return A ggplot2 object.
